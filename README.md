# VLM Benchmark

## Setup environment
The following instruction setup the environment using `conda`:
```
conda create -n benchmark python=3.11
conda activate benchmark
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
```
Some models are used with `ollama`, so install it first before running inference.
